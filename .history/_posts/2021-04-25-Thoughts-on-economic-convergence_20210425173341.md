title: Thoughts on economic convergence
---

I read this interesting article about how developing economies are at an advantage growth-rate wise to developed economies for reasons such as low labour costs, ability to attract capital due to lower operating costs, ability to learn and acquire technology from others as opposed to developing it themselves, etc. Consequently, developing economies typically grow at a faster rate than developed economies (of course there are exceptions, and cases where aforementioned reasons aren't true; however in general it seems like a relatively valid pattern)

Perhaps the more interesting point raised in the article was that economies don't necessarily converge to the same level. For instance, Japan caught up to the US in terms of GDP per capita rapidly in the post-war period, and was considered in per capita terms a candidate for surpassing the US, the leading economy (in per capita terms) of relatively large population and total size. However, its momentum fell and GDP per capita stagnated for decades to its modern value of approx. 40000 USD whilst the US soared to approx. 65000 USD

title: Thoughts on economic convergence
---

I read this interesting article about how developing economies are at an advantage growth-rate wise to developed economies for reasons such as low labour costs, ability to attract capital due to lower operating costs, ability to learn and acquire technology from others as opposed to developing it themselves, etc. Consequently, developing economies typically grow at a faster rate than developed economies (of course there are exceptions, and cases where aforementioned reasons aren't true; however in general it seems like a relatively valid pattern). Moreover, it appears that the pattern could be generalized to say that in general lower gdp per cap economies grow faster than higher ones.

Perhaps the more interesting point raised in the article was that economies don't necessarily converge to the same level. For instance, Japan caught up to the US in terms of GDP per capita rapidly in the post-war period, and was considered in per capita terms a candidate for surpassing the US, the leading economy (in per capita terms) of relatively large population and total size. However, its momentum fell and GDP per capita stagnated for decades to its modern value of approx. 40000 USD whilst the US soared to approx. 65000 USD.

Similar situation has been observed in other economies as well, for instance in Europe, where national gdp per cap values has stagnated at the 30000-50000 levels. The main exception to this is the US, which appear to still maintain stable annual gdp per cap growth of approx. 2% despite its already massive GDP per cap at approx. 65000 USD.

Institutional economists (based on my very basic understanding), might argue that such difference in convergence is due to institutions such as government structure, culture and so on. Another explanation could be natural factors such as geography and climate; for instance, the US has a long coastline and very expansive inland waterways that makes movement of goods much easier, and this might have played a role in it having higher economic potential than other stagnating economies.

Of course, given out sample size (there aren't many national economies to study from statistically speaking), this conjecture of different economic levels of convergence might be just a statistical illusion.

An additional point worth raising is that over the long term, productivity should form the baseline for GDP per cap; hence the stagnation in states such as Japan raises the question of whether it is related to productivity. For example, one could explain the stagnation in Japan to be due to stagnation of baseline economic productivity arising from the cancellation of the beneficial effects of technological innovation and the detrimental effects of aging population. This also helps explain other aging and stagnating economies such as those in Europe, and also helps to explain why the US, which has a comparatively more balanced age structure, can continue to grow. The issue with such explanation is countries which has age structures that are relatively balanced, like Australia, but do not enjoy the stable per cap growth like the US; hence even if this was an underlying explanation, it isn't the whole picture.

With that said, it is interesting to also consider the case of China. Like other Asian economies that have underwent explosive growth in past decades, China enjoyed a period of unprecedented economic growth and now faces the same issues of aging population. It is up to debate whether China's growth would continue indefinitely, or would it slow down and converge to some stable level like its counterpart Japan. From what I heard, at the same level of GDP per cap, China is growing at a lower rate than Japan did, which isn't good news as it hints that China might not develop per capita to the level of Japan. Then again, China is a much larger economy than Japan; hence such comparisons is not very reasonable, so it might still well be that China is only slower due to its sheer size, but it nevertheless has the potential to grow to a GDP per capita of the same scale as Japan or perhaps even more. Exactly what happens is up to the future and more experienced individual to predict (I lack the knowledge to make any quantitative predictions).

It is worth noting at the very end that GDP per capita is not necessarily the perfect indicator of economic development; especially as different agencies compute it against different criteria. This means then that validity of conclusions based on GDP per capita values (such as those above) could be less valid then what the numbers imply.

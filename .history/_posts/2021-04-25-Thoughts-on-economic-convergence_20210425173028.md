title: Thoughts on economic convergence
---

I read this interesting article about how developing economies are at an advantage growth-rate wise to developed economies for reasons such as low labour costs, ability to attract capital due to lower operating costs, ability to learn and acquire technology from others as opposed to developing it themselves, etc. Consequently, developing economies typically grow at a faster rate than developed economies (of course there are exceptions, and cases where aforementioned reasons aren't true; however in general it seems like a relatively valid pattern)

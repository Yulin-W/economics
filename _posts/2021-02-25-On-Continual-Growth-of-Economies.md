title: On Continual Growth of Economies
---

Just remembered an idea I heard quite a while ago, can't remember where it was from, that growth of economies (given the aim of maintaining a constant percentage growth) is exponential, and as such, it is unlikely to persist forever.

Now although exponential run away growth might seem unrealistic, I don't really find that by itself an argument against persistent growth. Most would not have expected back in the 1500s, or maybe even as late as 1800s, that human society would change and the economy grow so rapidly.

However, I guess there is a considerable slowdown in recent years, perhaps due to the recent digital industrial revolution losing momentum and the new industries created by it are becoming increasingly less profitable, and so grow slower, due to the tendency of diminishing marginal benefits. In which case, an optimistic view would be that a fourth industrial revolution, maybe due to machine learning/artificial intelligence, will bring about a new period of economic boom. Or perhaps genetic technologies might fill that role.

Coming from another standpoint, looking at history, it would appear that the decades since WWII was largely a bull market, where depressions and recessions occurs, but generally at least globally ease away within a few years. Long downturns like the Great Depression hasn't occured since. Whilst some might argue it is due to rapidly increasing productivity that provides the backbone for this growth, others argue, based on figures such as skyrocketing P/E ratios in shares and share market to GDP ratios, that there's a great bubble in the market.

Maybe, maybe not. Even if there is a serious bubble that has accumulated for more than half a century, whether it'll pop is anyone's guess. Bubbles by nature (at least from what I've read about) will eventually pop, but exactly when is a perplexing and highly unpredictable, especially with governments and central banks now much more experienced with preventing such sudden events. 

On the positive side. Even in the worst case of a bubble pop, I feel life won't become too bad; the baseline productivity rate has indeed increased considerably since WWII (technology has advanced considerably), so even with a bubble pop, living standard should still have improved significantly compared to decades ago, just perhaps not as much.

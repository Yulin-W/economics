title: Thoughts on the importance of urban planning
---

A bit of a background first, as of the time of writing, I've been looking up urban development news at least weekly for at least the past 5-6 years, ranging from matters such as policy, introducing external investments, infrastructuring planning and so on, particularly regarding cities in China (for they seem to have the most news due to how fast they're developing).

Initially, I focused on urban planning, things like transport, roads, facilities like schools/hospitals, seeing those as essential to the development of a city. However, as years went by, and I saw some comparatively bad yet still well functioning developments, for instance, the Shanghai Pudong CBD in terms of lack of transit yet still being a strong financial hub, it appeared to me that factors such as the overall environment and investments far dominate over the technical aspects of urban planning.

Looking in hindsight, that should have been plain obvious; a city is an agglomeration of commerce and in the end, people come in pursuit of employment, earnings, and so on. Even now there are still many cities with significant populations who don't live there permanently, but only for periods where they can find work there. As such, intricate matters of urban planning, such as walkable neighborhoods, pleasant, modern transit and beautifully maintained parks are not as important as I would have thought initially. A simple mind experiment should explain this; would you go in a slum with 6 digit work opportunities, or a a fabulous, state of the art city with say 2-30000 per annum income?

Of course some might prefer the latter, in paricular as this experiment depends on what numbers you substitute in and how bad the slum is, but personally I'd rather go for the slum case.

Moreover, one should also consider this; if you really could only earn 2-30000 per annum, you likely even won't have the choice of living in a state of the art city; you won't be able to pay the rent.

I understand these arguments are not rigorous (especially for mathematically/scientifically inclined individuals), but I hope the point gets across; the primary attraction of a city is first its employment and earnings opportunities, then whether say it is a well planned city that is a nice place to live.

Now I think some recognise the issue here, that urban planning and employment/work opporunity are interconnected, and thus one cannot simply separate the two factors. Whilst that is true, my experience looking at studies over the past years suggest that the planning factor is often secondary. It is, at least for naturally appear cities, what appears after the city becomes rich with work and gdp and not before; i.e., urban planning is often not what makes a city attractive (in the employment sense), but it is the employment and the riches that come with it that in turn makes it viable to improve the city's hardware.

Exceptions would include those new modern cities, such as say Shenzhen in China, where the city was not developed naturally but with strong top down planning. However, even in that case, one should recognise that urban planning was only a small part of the rise of Shenzhen; perhaps more importantly was its proximity to the Eurasian shipping route, its coastal position, and perhaps most importantly being close to the international financial hub that is Hong Kong. After all, out of the numerous cities China supported during its initial phases of opening to foreign investment including Dalian, Xiamen, Shenzhen; Shenzhen excelled economically far better than her counterparts. Whilst there are countless reasons behind this, whose discussion is perhaps more suitable for an academic paper, I personally believe at least that urban planning is not a major factor.

Now in some sense, the above is more like a rant on my naive conceptions towards the importance of urban planning, so if you read to this position, thank you for not getting bored.

The concluding idea, I suppose then, is to focus more on macroeconomics and policy than urban planning when it comes to evaluating the potential of a city, even when it comes to urban planning itself.

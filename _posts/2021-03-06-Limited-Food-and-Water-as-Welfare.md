title: Limited Food and Water as Welfare
---

I should first note that personally I do not stand as a proponent nor opponent for such policy as of writing, but am just interested in what effects it would have and causes of resistance towards it.

This was just a random thought (as such probably rather naive sounding as I haven't read through much literature on the matter) as I read about notions of human rights and whether governments should provide it. It seemed that at least for those governments which already provided universal (or at least highly subsidised) healthcare and education, that it makes sense to offer universal basic (important, here we mean basic) food/water requirements.

After all, food/water appears to be more fundamental requirements of people over healthcare and education, at least to me.

Of course, such welfare should be restricted to basics; the level to which survival is required for, and I doubt that would require much funds (at least in comparison to say universal healthcare).

There are already many implementations of such idea, especially among poorer members of society and children (e.g. free school lunch programs) and historically it seems this has been very common during economic downturns.

The more interesting question then is not if there are any such programs, but why such food/water programs haven't became as pervasive as say education.

Maybe the simplest answer (here I focus on more developed locations as elsewhere I lack the knowledge to comment), is that in more fortunate families of the world, food/water isn't as financially significant as health/education expenditures, and so they don't find it an urgent need for governments to intervene in the matter, and so neither does the government feel a need for doing this for the general population; they need only focus on the less fortunate ones which most are already doing.

Perhaps there is also a cultural dimension on how food should be obtained through one's own work as opposed to being given it (though I doubt this is a major factor, at most it is likely just a minor reason). From this stance, perhaps not introducing such policy is simply trying to be consistent with the idea of only giving what must be given, such that one will not establish an overly strong sense of entitlement.

Also, food/water is not as "public" (I believe there's a special term for this kind of stuff) as matters such as a good environment, social security, etc., in that food/water can be bought by one for oneself, whereas the latter when bought will serve not only oneself but the entire community. Consequently, the lack of private incentives to work on matters such as environment (because the individual doing so privately, due to the public good nature of the environment, is in effect working for free to improve others as well, and this whilst morally sound isn't necessarily economically rational) makes it more suitable as a public responsibility, i.e. one of the the government's; this, however does not apply for food/water for reasons aforementioned.

It should be noted that the above does not mean it is bad for governments to be tasked with food/water, it is simply that this specific factor of being a "public" consumable good which makes something more suitable for governments to handle doesn't apply to food/water. Government, for instance, might see food/water welfare as an important force of stability, and thus allocate funds for it.

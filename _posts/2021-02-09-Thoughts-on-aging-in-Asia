Taking history into consideration, Asian economies are aging at perhaps the fastest rate ever. With that said, the states which had developed earlier, e.g. Japan, Singapore, seem to be faring relatively well, in the sense that the rather unhealthy portion of labour force in the population hasn't destroyed the economy, but just stagnated it at an already high level.

The question remains though of the upcoming major aging state, China, who compared to its counterparts is aging yet without the same level of per capita economic development as say Japan. Hopefully a way out is discovered, for if China's economy stagnates, or even declines, then being the powerhouse it is, I feel the world economy suffer a huge blow.

There is also the chance for other states of cheap labour, e.g. India, South East Asia, or African nations to takeup some of China's lower end industries which it would eventually give up as its population ages and wages increase. In which case, we might see new powerhouse(s) propelling the world economy, especially given the population potentials of Africa.

Then again, the level of automation might prove to be too high of a barrier for less developed nations, such that even if wages were to increase in China and other states, they can still press down costs via technology, which poorer nations likely cannot imitate and so do not receive transfer of industries like say China did from Japan and US in the past decades. In which case, maybe global inequality will continue to rise with developing states trapped.

Of course, that is a pessimistic projection; optimists might argue that as democratization of technology pushes on (the internet is a major force for this) and globalization deepens, the opposite of the above could occur.  We'll just have to wait for time to tell.

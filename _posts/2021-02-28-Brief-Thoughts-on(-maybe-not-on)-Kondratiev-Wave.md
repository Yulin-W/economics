title: Brief Thoughts on (maybe not on) Kondratiev Wave
---

Now firstly, I haven't looked too deeply into the theory, so these are just first impressions that shouldn't be taken seriously.

So I came across the notion of Kondratiev waves, or to put it more simply, a longer version of the business cycle idea where the world economy operates in cycles lasting for decades, say 40-60 years, each with periods of boom and busts.

The theory does fit well with the past and to an extent the future since its inception, though to be honest, the theory only really covers 5 such waves, and by its inception already 2 waves have came and the 3rd was in the process, so the sample size is so small that it is hard to evaluate how predictive it is, at least without going into more detailed predictions of the theory (which I haven't read enough about to comment on).

Hence, the below is more so a generic thought about theories like the Kondratiev Wave. Personally, I feel the theory is one of those with a strong assumption on what happens in the past will occur in the future. Now that in itself is not necessarily a problem, science to a good degree is based on this inductive way of thinking.

However, as far as I know (and I admit I don't know much), most of the time where induction works to produce a simple and robust conclusion is on more so basic principles in simpler systems, e.g. how does a spherical cow fall in an airless environment of constant accelerations? (a quadratic of time describes the height of the cow). This is relatively easy, but once you introduce complexities like air resistance, variable gravitation, and a cow that isn't spherical, the problem becomes far more complicated and simple patterns disappear.

In economics, one deals with a rather complicated system, perhaps even an intrinsically chaotic one, one that has many uncertainties. Hence it is very rare to have a well-obeyed law in economics, particularly when timespans of decades are considered, such as with the Kondratiev wave.

Consequently, I personally place doubt on the accuracy of the Kondratiev wave theory; moreover, due to the small sample size for validating it, its credibility is somewhat lacking.

Of course, I might well be wrong, after all I haven't looked much into the topic (and I did say don't take the above seriously). Additionally, placing what I feel is true beside, looking at the issue from a like/dislike perspective, I very much like the Kondratiev Wave idea for its recurring nature and hypothesized universal applicability at least for several centuries. It the theory turned out, after the test of time, to be sufficiently valid, it'd be wonderful in the sense that it pins down some of one's life uncertainties.

For me, whilst unexpected events in life are good and interesting, I would like to also have some certainty in what will occur decades later, so that I have some peace of mind towards my future and a sense of securit. This is, as long as of course it isn't an overly pessimistic prediction, in which case maybe not knowing might be better.
